= Spring Boot and Two DataSources

This project demonstrates how to use two `DataSource` s with Spring Boot 2.1.

It utilizes: 

* Spring Data https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-jpa[JPA]
* https://github.com/flyway/flyway[Flyway] migrations for the two `DataSource` s
* Separate Hibernate properties for each `DataSource` defined in the application.yml
* Unit tests for components

 Note: It may take a few seconds for the app to start if no one has not accessed it recently
